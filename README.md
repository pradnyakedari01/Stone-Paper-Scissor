# Stone Paper Scissor Game

This Python project implements the classic Stone Paper Scissor game where a user plays against the computer. The program is interactive, lightweight, and easy to use.

How It Works
User Input:
The user chooses one of the three options: Stone (st), Paper (p), or Scissor (s).

Computer's Choice:
The computer randomly selects one of the three options using Python's random module.

Game Logic:
The user's choice and the computer's choice are compared to determine the winner using predefined rules:
Stone beats Scissor
Scissor beats Paper
Paper beats Stone
A tie occurs when both selections are the same.

Result Display:
The program announces the computer's choice, 
the user's choice, 
and the game result (Win, Lose, or Tie).

Features:
Interactive command-line interface.
Randomized computer decisions ensure fair play.
Clear result messages for user feedback.

Future Enhancements:
Add a scoring system to track wins, losses, and ties over multiple rounds.
Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more engaging experience.
Enable multiplayer functionality.
